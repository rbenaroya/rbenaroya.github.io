      <h2>How It All Began</h2>
      <p>
      1974 - Dan, Eugene, Gary and Russell were working in the coal mines in West Virginia.  It was a tough life.  16 hour days in a cold, dark, dank musty cave.  They were frustrated.  They needed to do something different.

      <h2>No One Said It Would Be Easy</h2>
      <p>
        One night over some Olde English liquor the four of them decided to make a change.  They wanted risk.  They wanted adventure.  They needed to break out.  So there and then they decided to leave the coal mines and start --- EXTREME ADVENTURES.  It started with a trip to Brazil.  After robbing a bank (oops, did I just say that?) they headed South to the cliffs of Aribianca where they scaled and then dove off 100 meter platforms.  Gary unfortunately didn't make it after hitting a rock but the three of them forged on and headed to Patagonia to ice climb on the glaciers.  Russell had a bit of a slip up and fell 300 feet into the freezing ocean and could not be saved.  That's okay.  Today Dan and Eugene are carrying the vision forward!
